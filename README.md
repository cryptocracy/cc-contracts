CryptoCash (CC) is a PoX-Lite SIP-010 token launched on the Stacks blockchain, enabling a
unique ecosystem of decentralized yield generation and asset-backed token circulation. This
ecosystem leverages the security of Bitcoin, bringing real value to CC holders through a dual
mechanism: STX-based mining to introduce new tokens into circulation and a stacking reward
system whereby users earn STX yields based on miner contributions.

# How it Works
- Miners input STX, for chance to mine new CryptoCash into circulation.
- Stackers stacking CryptoCash receives 95% of STX input
- Foundation Service Fee receives 5% of STX input
